            <h3> Hello World! I am Jeet Shah </h3> 
            a software development student with a passion for technology and a thirst to do something fun ü§ü with coding üë®‚Äçüíª.
            I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills(and also so that i don't forget how to code ‚úåÔ∏è) and knowledge
            in the field of software development. With a strong foundation
            in programming and problem-solving, I am confident in my ability
            to tackle complex technical challenges and deliver high-quality solutions to any problem.
            I love attending workshops, participating in 
            hackathons, or taking on new projects.
            I firmly believe that staying updated with the latest 
            technologies and trends is crucial in this fast-paced industry.
